2.0.0-rc2
[12.08.13]

- Add Resizer v0.1, a light-weight modern alternative to phpThumb. Resizer is built
  on Imagine, supports the Gmagick, Imagick and GD extensions and is considerably
  faster than phpThumb for scaling/cropping operations. Plus all the ZC options now
  work with GD. Enable in System Settings. Requires PHP 5.3 or higher.
- Fix a PHP warning the phpThumbOfCacheManager plugin was throwing.



2.0.0-rc1
---------

- Major refactor for improved efficiency, especially when used multiple times on
  a page or when an image is already cached.
- Remove Amazon S3 support. I don't use or know much about this and rather than
  release completely untested and possibly broken code, I took it out.  If you'd
  like it added back and are interested in helping, please get in touch.
- Improve remote image handling. Originals are now downloaded to the cache to
  greatly speed up future access
- Improve debugging output, including easy access to the phpThumb debug messages
  created when a thumbnail is generated (new &debug property for phpThumbOf)


1.0.0-beta2
-----------

- Add resource id # to error log message to make finding problem images easier


1.0.0-beta1
-----------

- Initial Commit. Forked from phpThumbOf 1.4.0.
- Improve cache management and performance: the cache manager plugin has been changed
  to only clean the cache; it doesn't completely clear it.  Cache cleanup is only done
  on OnSiteRefresh events instead of every time phpThumbOf is run (which previously
  didn't work anyway), improving overall performance
